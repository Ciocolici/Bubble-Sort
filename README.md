# Bubble Sort
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Bubble Sort.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
